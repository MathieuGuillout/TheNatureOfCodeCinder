The nature of code examples (w/ cinder)
=======================================

- The nature of code : http://natureofcode.com/

This is a great book to understand and implement the programming strategies and techniques behind computer simulations of natural systems. The book examples are in processing. And I wanted to learn more about cinder. So I just try to reimplement every book example with Cinder.

- Cinder : http://libcinder.org/

Cinder is a community-developed, free and open source library for professional-quality creative coding in C++.

To build an example
-------------------
You should have CINDER_PATH defined as a environment variable

cd into the example folder

make

It should build and run the example
